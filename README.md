# qmp_algorithm
## Algorithm for the quantum marginal problem: 

Given a set of quantum marginals and prescribed spectra (or rank),
the algorithm looks for a global density matrix compatible with the inputs.

The file ``codes_qmp.py`` contains all the codes that are implemented in the  ``qmp_algorithm`` jupyter-notebook. The notebook contains examples with descriptions.
